# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a vector database system using LangChain that can store, index, and retrieve document embeddings for semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. The system will enable users to ingest documents, convert them to vector embeddings, store them efficiently, and perform similarity searches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ingest and store documents in a vector database, so that I can perform semantic search and retrieval operations on my document collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a document or text content THEN the system SHALL convert the content into vector embeddings using LangChain
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in a vector database with associated metadata
3. WHEN documents are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain document identifiers and original content references
4. IF the document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform semantic similarity searches on stored documents, so that I can find relevant content based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a search query THEN the system SHALL convert the query to vector embeddings
2. WHEN query embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search against stored document vectors
3. WHEN similarity search is performed THEN the system SHALL return ranked results with similarity scores
4. WHEN no similar documents are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure different embedding models and vector stores, so that I can optimize performance and accuracy for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the system THEN the user SHALL be able to specify the embedding model to use
2. WHEN configuring the vector store THEN the user SHALL be able to choose from supported vector database backends including local storage and AWS S3
3. WHEN AWS S3 is selected as the vector store THEN the system SHALL support S3 bucket configuration with proper authentication
4. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration parameters
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with correction guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage document collections with CRUD operations, so that I can maintain and update my vector database over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new documents THEN the system SHALL support batch and individual document insertion
2. WHEN updating existing documents THEN the system SHALL re-generate embeddings and update the vector store
3. WHEN deleting documents THEN the system SHALL remove both the vectors and associated metadata
4. WHEN querying document metadata THEN the system SHALL return document information without performing vector operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to persist the vector database to disk or cloud storage, so that my document embeddings are preserved between application sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN the user SHALL be able to specify a persistent storage location (local disk or AWS S3)
2. WHEN documents are added or modified THEN the system SHALL automatically persist changes to the configured storage backend
3. WHEN the system is restarted THEN the system SHALL load existing vectors and metadata from persistent storage
4. WHEN using AWS S3 storage THEN the system SHALL handle S3 authentication, bucket access, and network connectivity issues
5. IF persistent storage is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and recovery options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use AWS S3 as a vector database backend, so that I can leverage cloud storage for scalability and durability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring S3 as the vector store THEN the system SHALL support AWS credentials configuration (access key, secret key, region)
2. WHEN storing vectors in S3 THEN the system SHALL organize data efficiently using appropriate S3 key structures
3. WHEN retrieving vectors from S3 THEN the system SHALL optimize for query performance and minimize API calls
4. WHEN S3 operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. IF S3 authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about credential issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security controls for the vector database, so that I can protect sensitive documents and ensure data privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL support encryption at rest for both local and S3 storage
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use TLS/SSL encryption for all network communications
3. WHEN accessing the system THEN the system SHALL support authentication mechanisms (API keys, JWT tokens)
4. WHEN performing operations THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user permissions
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL support data masking and PII detection in documents
6. WHEN storing API keys or credentials THEN the system SHALL never log or expose sensitive configuration data
7. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and implement rate limiting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive observability and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track system performance, debug issues, and ensure reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is performed THEN the system SHALL generate structured logs with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for embedding generation time, storage operations, and search latency
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error traces with correlation IDs for debugging
4. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL expose health check endpoints for monitoring system status
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for memory usage, CPU utilization, and storage I/O
6. WHEN integrating with external services THEN the system SHALL support distributed tracing for end-to-end request tracking
7. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL emit alerts and warnings before failures occur
